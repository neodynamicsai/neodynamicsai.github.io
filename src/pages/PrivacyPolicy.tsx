            This Privacy Policy explains how NeoDynamics (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal
            information gathered through our products, services, websites, and marketing programs. It covers our obligations
            under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the
            California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA/CPRA), and similar global privacy regulations.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            We provide this notice at or before the point of collection so you can decide how we use your information. It
            covers any personal information you share directly, data we observe through product usage, and details supplied by
            third-party partners. We do not collect additional categories of information without updating this notice and, where
            required, obtaining fresh consent.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Categories of Personal Information We Collect</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Depending on your interactions with NeoDynamics, we may collect the following categories of personal information:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-muted-foreground list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Identifiers: name, email address, phone number, company, job title, device identifiers, and IP address.</li>
            <li>Professional details: role, team size, identity infrastructure, and deployment preferences.</li>
            <li>Commercial information: purchase history, license status, and billing records.</li>
            <li>Usage data: authentication events, feature telemetry, diagnostic logs, and session metadata.</li>
            <li>Sensitive personal information: administrator credentials or security context you deliberately submit for
              assessment services. We limit use of these details to providing the requested service and apply strict access
              controls.</li>
            <li>Inferences: risk scores and remediation recommendations derived from automated analysis of your identity estate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            We retain each category only for as long as needed to deliver our services, comply with legal obligations,
            resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. If exact retention periods vary, we apply documented criteria based on the
            sensitivity of the information, regulatory timelines, and contractual requirements.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Sources of Personal Information</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            We gather data from the information you provide directly, automated monitoring of our products, publicly available
            sources such as professional networking sites, partners who resell or integrate NeoDynamics, and security telemetry
            supplied by your organization’s systems when you connect them to our platform. We require partners and processors to
            contractually guarantee that any information they share with us was obtained lawfully.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">How We Use Personal Information</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            We use the collected information to deliver and improve our services, configure identity analytics, provide
            customer support, process transactions, secure our platforms, conduct research and product development, personalize
            communications, and meet legal or regulatory requirements. We do not use sensitive personal information for purposes
            beyond those necessary to perform or deliver the services you request unless we obtain your explicit consent.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Sharing Personal Information</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            We share personal information with service providers that support core operations (such as cloud hosting, payments,
            analytics, consent management, email delivery, and customer success). These providers must follow our contractual
            requirements, including data minimization, security controls, and prohibitions against selling or sharing your data
            for unrelated purposes. We may also disclose information to competent authorities when required by law or to protect
            NeoDynamics, our customers, or the public. We do not sell personal information or share it for cross-context
            behavioral advertising.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">International Transfers</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            We operate globally and may transfer personal information to countries whose privacy laws differ from those in your
            jurisdiction. When we transfer data outside the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we rely on
            appropriate safeguards such as the latest Standard Contractual Clauses, Transfer Impact Assessments, and additional
            technical controls (encryption, pseudonymization) to maintain equivalent protection levels.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Where the GDPR applies, we process personal information under one or more of these bases: performance of a contract
            with your organization; legitimate interests in securing and improving identity threat defenses; compliance with
            legal obligations; protection of vital interests; or your consent, which you may withdraw at any time without
            affecting prior lawful processing.

            Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or restrict use of your personal
            information; object to certain processing; opt out of automated decision making; and limit the use or disclosure of
            sensitive personal information. California residents may also request details about data disclosure, opt out of
            sharing, and direct us to correct or delete personal information. We respond to verified requests within 45 days (or
            notify you if we need up to 90 days) and do not discriminate for exercising these rights.

            You can submit a request by emailing privacy@neodynamics.ai or through our web form. When acting on behalf of an

            authorization.
